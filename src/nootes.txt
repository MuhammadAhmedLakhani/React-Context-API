----deep component data transfer

*lIKE IN THIS EXAMPLE WE ARE PASSING AN OBJECT FROM profile to button
*but this is not straight forward as there is nested component between them 

*so obj is passed from profile first and then it is passed to button component through the Appcard component through use of props

*imagine if the nested compoent is 10 time nested from the paent component
*sending data from parent to deep nested child will be a nightmare


----redux a solution

*redux another third party library solve this problem but it was complex to manage
*complexities include:
1)it is a javascript library
2)react-redux was needed to implment redux festures like action(a function containing types of tasks) and reducers(another function)
3)for asyncronous tasks like api call during action calling 
so to solve this issue another library middleware has to be use for asyncromous tasks

*for more complex data we still use redux
