----deep component data transfer

*lIKE IN THIS EXAMPLE WE ARE PASSING AN OBJECT FROM profile to button
*but this is not straight forward as there is nested component between them 

*so obj is passed from profile first and then it is passed to button component through the Appcard component through use of props

*imagine if the nested compoent is 10 time nested from the paent component
*sending data from parent to deep nested child will be a nightmare


----redux a solution

*redux another third party library solve this problem but it was complex to manage
*complexities include:
1)it is a javascript library
2)react-redux was needed to implment redux festures like action(a function containing types of tasks) and reducers(another function)
3)for asyncronous tasks like api call during action calling 
so to solve this issue another library middleware has to be use for asyncromous tasks

*for more complex data we still use redux


----context api(here comes context api with a bang)

*allows deep component data transfer

*first we need to make seprate context folder and a seprate file for context initialization

*in our case we initialize our context in UserContext.js by using create-context there and provide null as value;

*`then we import the initialization (in our case "User") in our app.jsx file

*created context provide us .Provider component which we wrapped around our parent compoenet

*Provider Component take value keyword as propname(value is necessary name here)

*we provide usestate hook  to .Provider value prop

*now we able to get the user(set through useState hook) value 
inside button component though use of useContext() there
