----deep component data transfer

*lIKE IN THIS EXAMPLE WE ARE PASSING AN OBJECT FROM profile to button
*but this is not straight forward as there is nested component between them 

*so obj is passed from profile first and then it is passed to button component through the Appcard component through use of props

*imagine if the nested compoent is 10 time nested from the paent component
*sending data from parent to deep nested child will be a nightmare
